      answer:
        "Registering for events on Eventra is simple! Browse available events on our Events or Hackathons pages, click on the event you're interested in, and click the 'Register' or 'Join Event' button. You'll need to create an account if you don't have one. Follow the registration prompts, provide any required information, and you're all set!

Choose your event type (workshop, hackathon, conference, etc.), fill in the event details like title, description, date, location, and capacity.

      question: "What is the difference between a workshop and a hackathon?",
      answer:
        "Workshops are typically educational or skill-building sessions focused on learning specific topics, tools, or techniques. They're usually shorter (a few hours to a full day) and more structured. Hackathons are competitive coding events where participants work in teams to build projects within a limited timeframe (usually 24-48 hours). Hackathons emphasize innovation, collaboration, and rapid prototyping, often with prizes and judging involved.",

You can join events, create your own events, and access most features without any cost. Some premium features for large-scale events or enterprise users may have associated costs, but the core platform remains free for communities, educational institutions, and individual organizers.",

These external communities are managed by volunteers and provide spaces for ongoing conversations beyond individual events. You can join these communities to stay updated on upcoming events, find team members for hackathons, get help with the platform, and connect with like-minded people in your area or field of interest.",
